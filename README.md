DESCRIPTION
-------------
Welcome to pyCal! PyCal is an innovative and reimagined idea of a calendar 
planner. pyCal allows users to not only track their scheduled events throughout 
days, weeks, months, and years, but also keeps track of to-do items. Up-coming 
events and to-do items are automatically ordered based on due date, availability,
and priority into a handy sidebar that allows users to see what they need to be 
doing next. These tasks can also be scheduled automatically into the calendar 
around previously scheduled events and tasks.

-------------------
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------
To start application, simply run the PyCal.py file

--------------------
MODULE INSTALLATION
--------------------
*Module Installations required*
1) Requests - pip install requests
2) BeautifulSoup4 - pip install bs4

pyCal also requires the use of modules such as calendar, time, pickle modules. 
However, these libraries are a part of the standard library, so no extra 
installation is required. 

After the above, the program runs with the files provided. If event_data and 
task_data files are not already provided, then don't worry, they will be created 
when you run the application.
